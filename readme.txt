== Description ==

Features include:

* Records basic incremental impressions of each post and page.
* Displays the count in a post or page with shortcode.
* Eight image libraries included. You may use any digit image set you like.
* Scales digit images dynamically (as defined in your shortcode).

* Full list of features on our [website](http://www.beliefmedia.com/wp-plugins/simple-post-counter.php).

**Simple Post Counter** is simple in that it's lightweight and only does what's advertised. Various analytics programs (and other impression tools like AdSense) tend to fail miserably when providing a live page impression counts, and displaying that information on your page is challenging. This plugin is designed to provide an immediate, real time, and accurate page impression count.

Future versions will add more features and functionality.
